## 🚨 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

### **How to Report**

If you discover a security vulnerability in Process Key Sender, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at: [security@process-key-sender.dev](mailto:security@process-key-sender.dev)
3. **Use encrypted communication** if possible (PGP key available on request)

### **What to Include**

Please provide the following information in your security report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Affected versions** (if known)
- **Possible mitigation** or fix suggestions
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (critical issues within 7 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### **Application Security**

#### **Input Validation**
- All user inputs (configuration files, CLI arguments) are validated
- JSON parsing uses safe deserialization practices
- Key combinations are sanitized to prevent injection

#### **Process Targeting**
- Process names are validated against system processes
- No arbitrary code execution through process names
- Limited to existing, running processes only

#### **File System Access**
- Configuration files are read-only operations
- No arbitrary file system access
- Temporary files use secure creation methods

### **Platform-Specific Security**

#### **Windows Security**
- Uses Windows API safely with proper error handling
- No privilege escalation attempts
- Respects Windows User Account Control (UAC)
- Limited to user-space operations only

#### **Future Linux/Unix Support**
- Will follow principle of least privilege
- X11/Wayland integration will be sandboxed
- No root privileges required or requested

### **Network Security**
- **No network communication** - the application is completely offline
- No telemetry, analytics, or data collection
- No automatic updates or phone-home functionality

## ⚠️ **Threat Model & Limitations**

### **What We Protect Against**
- ✅ **Configuration file tampering** (validation and sanitization)
- ✅ **Input injection attacks** (safe parsing and validation)
- ✅ **Unauthorized process access** (proper permission checks)
- ✅ **Memory safety** (Rust's built-in memory safety)

### **What We DON'T Protect Against**
- ❌ **User running as administrator** - we cannot prevent privilege misuse
- ❌ **Anti-virus false positives** - automation tools may trigger AV
- ❌ **Target application vulnerabilities** - we can't control target apps
- ❌ **Social engineering** - users choosing malicious configurations

### **Inherent Risks**
This tool can send keystrokes to applications, which inherently carries risks:

1. **Unintended Actions**: Misconfigured automation may cause unintended effects
2. **Application Crashes**: Rapid key sending might crash target applications
3. **Data Loss**: Automated key presses could trigger destructive actions
4. **Account Restrictions**: Use with online services may violate Terms of Service

## 🔐 **Best Practices for Users**

### **Safe Usage**
- ✅ **Test configurations** in safe environments first
- ✅ **Use low intervals** to avoid overwhelming applications
- ✅ **Monitor automation** - don't leave it unattended
- ✅ **Keep backups** of important data before automation
- ✅ **Use with offline applications** only

### **Configuration Security**
- ✅ **Validate JSON files** before use (use online JSON validators)
- ✅ **Use example configs** as templates
- ✅ **Avoid executable file names** in process names
- ✅ **Review all settings** before running

### **System Security**
- ✅ **Run with minimal privileges** (don't use as administrator unless necessary)
- ✅ **Keep Windows Defender enabled** (or other AV)
- ✅ **Update your system** regularly
- ✅ **Use latest version** of Process Key Sender

## 🏗️ **Secure Development Practices**

### **Code Security**
- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust for automatic memory management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow`
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Safe Dependencies**: Regular dependency audits with `cargo audit`

### **Build Security**
- **Reproducible Builds**: Consistent build environment
- **Dependency Pinning**: Locked dependency versions in `Cargo.lock`
- **Clean Build Environment**: No external network access during build
- **Release Signing**: Planned for future releases

### **Testing**
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality covered by tests
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with safe configurations
- **Fuzzing**: Planned input fuzzing for configuration parsing
- **Security Audits**: Regular code reviews focusing on security

## 🔍 **Vulnerability Disclosure Program**

## 📋 **Security Checklist for Contributors**

### **Before Submitting Code**
- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets** or credentials
- [ ] **Input validation** for all user inputs
- [ ] **Error handling** doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] **Safe API usage** with proper error checking
- [ ] **No arbitrary code execution** paths
- [ ] **Memory safety** considerations addressed

### **Dependencies**
- [ ] **Audit new dependencies** with `cargo audit`
- [ ] **Minimize dependency surface** area
- [ ] **Use well-maintained crates** only
- [ ] **Pin versions** appropriately
- [ ] **Review security advisories** before adding deps

## 🚫 **Known Security Limitations**

### **By Design**
1. **Keystroke Injection**: The tool is designed to inject keystrokes - this is the intended functionality
2. **Process Targeting**: Must access other processes to function
3. **User Permissions**: Inherits all permissions of the user running it

### **Current Limitations**
1. **No Encryption**: Configuration files are stored in plain text
2. **No Authentication**: No user authentication or access controls
3. **Global Scope**: Windows implementation may affect system-wide state

### **Planned Improvements**
1. **Configuration Encryption**: Planned for v0.2.0
2. **Process Sandboxing**: Investigating safer process interaction
3. **Audit Logging**: Optional security event logging
4. **Digital Signatures**: Code signing for releases
